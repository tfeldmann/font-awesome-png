font-awesome-png
================

This repository contains all the Font Awesome Icons as png files.

This files are generated with the converter found at @odyniec/font-awesome-to-png and uploaded in different sizes and colors.
The converter has a bug that some icons are cut off at the borders. I adjusted the font-size a bit to handle that.

Contributions are welcome!
